First I went to the docker page, learnt about them, what it is and where can we use it.
It was a anew thing for me and found it quiet cool.
Then I jumped to their documentaiton and read about the environment and contenaristaion.
Their documentaion was enough to build make the Dockerfile but not enough for building and pushing.
I suffered almost a day to access "testfile.sh" and another few hours getting past their "latest" tag.
For pushing i had to resort to a youtube vedio to resort the problem.
