	Prompted for username?
	Some users have reported that their Android AnyConnect clients prompt for a username and password. This is a known bug we don't understand. See the list of Streisand AnyConnect open issues. If you're affected, you could help us understand the bug by reporting your details using the issue list's New issue button's template. Fixes are gratefully accepted too.

	If you're affected, you can use this workaround:

	When prompted for a user, enter streisand
	When prompted for a password, use fade.adult.insane.spring.already

	iOS
	Note: When using AnyConnect for the first time, you may be prompted for a password prior to being connected. Enter streisand for the username, fade.adult.insane.spring.already for the password and continue. Subsequent connections will not prompt you again.
	Note: Only one AnyConnect profile can be configured at any give time. To remove an existing profile, go to Settings -> General -> Profile, tap on the profile you wish to remove, then tap on Remove Profile.

	major-walk.mobileconfig
	depend-shrimp.mobileconfig

	The profile can be emailed to your device (simply tap the attachment), transferred via the Apple Configurator utility, or downloaded directly by viewing these instructions on the device itself.
