After doing a ton of whois, and trying to find about the domain name, I thought of being someone who would want to buy a "ac.in " domain.
Hence i googled how to buy "ac.in", the i landed on "http://webservices.nic.in/" and "https://www.registry.ernet.in/Default.aspx" this webpage finally showed me how to buy ac.in domains.
So I guess the "students.iitmandi.ac.in" was bought through ERNET.
